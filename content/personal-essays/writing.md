For a very long time, I've wished to write like a native - to produce amazing blog posts or technical papers that everyone loves reading. But I've always had doubts about myself. How could I ever write at a level close to a native speaker? It felt soooo impossible, because I thought I still didn't have enough background knowledge and even my speaking skills were suck :(

But now, everything has to change, I don't want it to stay like this anymore. I really want to upskill myself, especially writing, because it will help me so much with networking and allow people around the world to know me.

So from today, I will start writing. I hope this goes well.
